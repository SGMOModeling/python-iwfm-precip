## **description:**
the scripts in this repository were developed for processing gridded precipitation data to an IWFM input file

Gridded precipitation data is available from several sources:

1. PRISM
2. USGS Basin Characterization Model (BCM)
3. daymet
4. NLDAS

## **How-To**

From the command line using a python environment that supports arcpy, run the following:

python iwfm_precip_processing.py input.txt
```
